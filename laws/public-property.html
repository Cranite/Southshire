            <h2>Public Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>Public infrastructure is anything designated to being publicly used, and can either be accessed by all, or only by members of the Southshire group. Public buildings cannot be privatised unless approved by the council. Roads are automatically public and so cannot be tolled. (Paths that lead from public roads to your house can be private, but they must be within your claim or plot. Paths that are outside claims or plots are public.)</p>

Considering that Southshire is becoming ever more developed, it is probably best that the rules for settlement be published.

# What is Southshire?

Southshire describes the borough located on the Southwestern Peninsular, and encompasses the entirety of the roofed forest biome. It does not include the mesa that acts as a land bridge between the Capital District and Southshire, which remains part of the CommonWealth proper. [(MAP)](http://imgur.com/NyLVMjB)

# Public Infrastructure

Public infrastructure is anything designated to being publicly used, and can either be accessed by all, or only by members of the Southshire group. Public buildings cannot be privatised unless approved by me, Orinnari. Roads are automatically public and so cannot be tolled. (Paths that lead from public roads to your house can be private, but they must be within your claim or plot. Paths that are outside claims or plots are public.)

# Private Property

Any building that you build is private unless explicitly stated otherwise. If you do decide to make it public, you will keep creative control of the building, which you can remake or move, but destroying the building without replacing it is griefing public infrastructure. Property must be built within recognised claims or plots, or otherwise approved by Orinnari. Expansions into neighbouring unclaimed plots, or into unmarked lands must also be approved.

# Y Levels

Southshire has reserved levels 100 to 110 inclusive. This is in order to create public infrastructure such as railways. While the government will try to build around stairways or basements that infringe on this reservation, if the space is needed, it will be reclaimed.

# Plots

It is recommended to build within the city centre, as the remaining lands of Southshire will likely be remodeled to meet the needs of the city. And so there are plenty of plots available, and few different kinds too. If a plot is marked with cobblestone, it is government land reserved for later use. If a plot is marked with wood, then that plot's primary function is residential. If a plot is marked with the -ites, then its primary function is commerce. If a plot is marked with hardened clay, then it's function is industry/farmland.

_(Primary function, or Ground Floor Function (GFF) describes what kind of building is accessible from the ground floor. You don't need to claim two plots, one for a house and one for a shop. You can have a [house above a shop](http://imgur.com/4NuaMQY) or vice versa for residential plots, but the primary function must mirror its designation.)_

# Requirements

1. All distinct buildings must be labelled, and must include who owns the building, and its primary function.

# Restrictions

1. Buildings can be tall, but above three floors and a roof/loft is too tall.

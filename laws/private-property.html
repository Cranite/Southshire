            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>Private property is a piece of land in which the owner has certain inalienable rights - that is to say until such time when they no longer own the property - to do with what they will, within reason. Private property is neither separate nor independent from the borough of Southshire, nor the sovereign nation of the CommonWealth. The government can and will intervene in such cases where building codes, or the conditions of ownership have been violated.</p>

            <h2>How to obtain land</h2>
            <p>Please do not simply find a spot that you like and start building, as that may be throwing off days, or even weeks worth of planning for how the city, and the borough as a whole will expand. And while plans may be changed to accommodate any unexpected builds, eminent domain may be used to reclaim that land. While in any such case the building materials will be returned and the owner compensated, it is generally unwise to build in random locations.<br/>
            <br/>
            And so the official ways of obtaining land are as follows:<br/>
            <p class="indent">1. Find an empty, unclaimed plot, and place a sign inside that designates you as the owner, and the primary function of the plot, and build on it within a week.<p>
            <p class="indent">2. If you cannot find a plot that you like in particular, talk to the members of the council to arrange an area that either creates a new plot, or combines a few unclaimed ones.</p></p>

            <h2>How to keep land</h2>
            <p>In order to keep any land that you have claimed, it must be necessary and used, a rule that is especially true within the city centre. If you do not need it and therefore do not use it, then after a period of time of disuse, it can be reclaimed by the government in order to keep the borough alive. We cannot keep the relics of past use or past citizens simply because they built them, as that land could be better served by someone else. If you are a regular citizen that keeps your shops stocked, then all will be good and your land will remain yours.</p>

            <h2>No private or tolled roads</h2>
            <p>Within the borders of Southshire, neither roads nor paths constitute as private property, even when they are within the bounds of your plot, and so travellers can use them without fear of trespass, nor owing payment.</p>

            <h2>Get off of my lawn!</h2>
            <p>You may demand that trespassers - players who have no legal or moral right to be there - leave the bounds of your land, and report or otherwise pearl those who refuse. Players may trespass on private property if they are reporting, documenting, or otherwise travelling - like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saatse_Boot">Saatse Boot</a> whereby people may travel through, but cannot stop on your land.</p>

            <h2>Y Levels</h2>
            <p>The claim of private property extends 20 blocks below the surface, or until it reaches reserved levels, whichever is first. The government has absolute claim over levels 100 through 110 inclusively. You can still build outside of your claim, but you will have no rights to those constructions, and they may be disassembled later as needed without needing your consent or knowledge.</p>

            <h2>Abandonment</h2>
            <p>If a property has been flagged as abandoned, then the government may keep the building materials and any treasures found within. Abandonment is when:<br/>
                <p class="indent">1. A player has informed the government that they are permenately leaving Southshire, the Commonwealth, or the server as a whole.<p>
                <p class="indent">2. When a player has been absent without explanation, as detailed in the constitution.</p>
                <p class="indent">3. When a property is being lawfully disassembled, and the owner knowingly and willingly refuses to help.</p>
